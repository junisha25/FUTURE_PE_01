For this internship project, I set out to create a complete YouTube video entirely using AI tools and prompt chaining techniques. My goal was to demonstrate how multiple AI systems can work together seamlessly to produce professional multimedia content from start to finish.

I began by using ChatGPT to understand the overall workflow and break down the production process into manageable steps. Then I turned to Claude to generate creative content—catchy YouTube titles, a detailed timestamped script, and thumbnail concepts for a comparison video analyzing ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini across five key domains: content writing, coding, research, study help, and brainstorming.
For the visual elements, I used Gemini to generate an AI-powered thumbnail based on a "Battle Royale" concept, featuring a confused person surrounded by competing AI logos. I then converted this static image into an animated intro clip using HailuoAI's image-to-video feature, adding dynamic motion to grab viewer attention.

The audio production involved using Canva's text-to-AI-speech converter to transform my script into a professional-sounding voiceover. For B-roll footage, I combined free stock videos from Pexels with AI-generated clips from Canva's Magic Media tool, ensuring each visual element aligned perfectly with the narration.

I assembled everything in Canva's video editor, syncing the voiceover with B-rolls, adding on-screen text for key takeaways, incorporating smooth transitions, and applying color grading to maintain a consistent visual style throughout the 5-minute video.

What makes this project unique is the structured prompt chaining approach—each AI tool was given specific, well-crafted prompts that built upon the previous outputs, creating a cohesive production pipeline. The final deliverable is a polished, engaging YouTube video titled "ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini: Which AI Wins?" that demonstrates the practical potential of AI collaboration in content creation.
This project taught me how to leverage multiple AI platforms strategically, balancing AI creativity with human curation to achieve professional results.
